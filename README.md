A speech to text app with an "always-listening" service

## Task

1. Implement the UI Screen from the [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/fkdwc6mGC4QdkrB5JlE2FU/Flutter-Assignment-UI?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)
2. Add "always-listening" mode for native Android in Kotlin"
3. Write tests for the Kotlin code
3. Create the Flutter app with the desired feature and architecture
5. Optional: write a small README () with some explanation

Alternative Task: (if you cannot do the Kotlin task)
- Implement the always-listening mode in Flutter instead of Kotlin. You are allowed to use Flutter packages for this. So the task is the same but you are free to use whatever you want in order to implement the functionality.
- The flutter code should still use BloC and Clean Architecture.
